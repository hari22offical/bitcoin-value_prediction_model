    <p><b>‚Ü™ PROBLEM STATEMENT:</b></p>
    <p>Presenting Bitcoin Price Prediction Using ML, a machine learning model that is implemented with certain algorithms to deduce the price of bitcoin with the given other details of the factors that influence the bitcoin price directions. Recently, bitcoin has reached a new peak in its popularity due to the law enforcements for tax deductions from the profits gained from bitcoin investments and returns in India. Bitcoin is a digital asset and a payment system that is used as a form of Internet currency. It allows for anonymous payment from one person to another and is therefore a preferred payment method for criminal actions on the Internet. Recently Bitcoin has received a lot of attention from the media and the public due to its recent price hike. The objective of this paper is to determine the predictable price direction of Bitcoin price. Machine learning models can likely give us the insight we need to learn about the future of Cryptocurrency. It will not tell us the future but it might tell us the general trend and direction to expect the prices to move. The proposed model is to build a machine learning model where the data is used to learn about the pattern in the dataset and the machine learning algorithm is used to predict the bitcoin price based on the directly affecting biases. With the effective feedback from the domain experts, we were able to approach the better version of the bitcoin price prediction model.</p>
